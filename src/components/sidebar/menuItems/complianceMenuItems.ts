/**
 * Compliance & Enforcement — Top-Level Menu
 *
 * Aligned with the finalized planning document. The structure preserves
 * every existing working route and adds placeholder routes only where a
 * target screen is not yet implemented (those resolve to PlaceholderPage).
 *
 * Permission model: existing legacy permission strings consumed by the
 * static sidebar path (see `useSupabaseAuth().hasPermission`). The
 * canonical model (`app_modules` + `module_actions`) continues to gate
 * the DB-driven sidebar — this file plugs into both surfaces.
 *
 * Feature toggles: hide-only safety gate via `isComplianceFeatureEnabled`
 * (see src/lib/compliance/featureToggles.ts). TODO: replace with the real
 * `ce_feature_toggles` admin screen when implemented.
